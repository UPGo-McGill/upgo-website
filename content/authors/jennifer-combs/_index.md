Jennifer completed her BA in Linguistics and Geography with a concentration in Urban Studies at McGill University in 2017. During her undergraduate studies, she became interested in new master-planned cities, and decided to pursue a Master of Urban Planning degree in order to further research the phenomenon. After starting her masterâ€™s studies at McGill, Jennifer became increasingly interested in data analysis, data visualization, and how cities can leverage data to develop evidence-based policies. Since graduating from the Master of Urban Planning program in 2019, Jennifer works as a transportation planner at Arup in New York.
