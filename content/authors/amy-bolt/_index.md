Amy completed her Bachelor's degree in Engineering with a minor in Project Management from McGill University in 2016. Having worked in the architecture and visual art industries, Amy took interest in examining and understanding the relationships between densification and community cohesion, and public art and gentrification. With a focus on short-term rentals, Amy is now a Masterâ€™s research assistant within the Urban Politics and Governance Research group with a specific focus on exploring the interactions between community resistance, social capital, and short-term rentals in major cities across North America. Amy is expected to complete her Master of Urban Planning from McGill University in 2020.
