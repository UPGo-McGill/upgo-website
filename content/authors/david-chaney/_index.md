David Chaney is a former researcher at UPGo from 2017 through 2018 and contributed to the group’s analysis of Airbnb’s impact on several housing markets and governance structures. He currently works in the City of Vancouver’s Affordable Housing Programs office. He works on several initiatives to implement the Housing Vancouver Strategy. One of these initiatives includes efforts to establish the Renter Centre, which requires broad interdepartmental cooperation and engagement with renter-serving organizations to help renters pursue their rights in an expensive housing market with low rental vacancy. Another initiative includes efforts to support the establishment of the Vancouver Affordable Housing Endowment Fund, which centralizes decision making and fund management in the City’s government to maximize affordable housing development.
