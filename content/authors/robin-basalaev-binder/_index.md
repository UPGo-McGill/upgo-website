Robin completed her undergraduate degree in Social Anthropology and Russian in 2013 and finished her Master of Urban Planning in 2018, both at McGill University. Her passion for social and racial justice, equity, as well as affordable and accessible housing has led her to pursue research centered on these issues. She has conducted studies exploring gentrification, urban resilience and sustainability, short-term rentals in the housing system, and the intersection of immigration and housing. Robin is particularly interested in how marginalized communities and individuals with vulnerable immigration status can participate in urban planning processes and advocacy. Her work focuses on the US, Canadian, and Latin American contexts. She plans to continue her research as a doctoral student with David Wachsmuth and UPGo in 2020.
