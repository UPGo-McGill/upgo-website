Lou Seltz received her BA in Economics from Bard College, where as a research assistant she first became interested in issues of land tenure, ecological economics, and food justice. After graduating with a fellowship from the Levy Economics Institute, Lou worked as a grassroots organizer to fight for political representation of small farmers across the US. Finding that some of the most inspiring activism was taking place at the level of local politics, she decided to turn to Urban Planning, and graduated in spring 2020 with a Master of Urban Planning from McGill University.
