Nat completed an undergraduate degree in Geography and Cultural Studies, with a minor in Women and Gender studies from Wilfrid Laurier University in 2017. Intersecting interests of critical social theory, mapping, and economic geography has led Nat to explore a variety of research interests, including local food systems, wildlife management, critical cartography, and transportation planning implications of ride-hailing services. Turning their attention now to short-term rentals, Nat is a research intern within the Urban Politics and Governance Research group, exploring the nature of short-term rentals in small towns across North America. They are expected to complete their Master of Urban Planning from McGill University in 2020.
