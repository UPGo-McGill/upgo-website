Danielle is a graduate of the Masterâ€™s program of the School of Urban Planning at McGill University. She grew up in Montevideo, Uruguay, and moved to Montreal to pursue an Honours BSc. in Environmental Studies. Her thesis focused on rural livelihoods in the Peruvian Amazon. During this time, she also interned at the World Food Programme in Havana, Cuba, an experience that strengthened her interest in sustainable planning for climate resilience and disaster risk management, as well as community-led capacity building and development. For her Master's program internship, she worked as a research assistant in the UPGo lab and pivoted her interests to look at housing markets and the impacts of short-term rentals on rural areas across Canada and the United States.
