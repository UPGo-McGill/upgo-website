Danielle is a masterâ€™s student in the School of Urban Planning at McGill University. She grew up in Montevideo, Uruguay, and moved to Montreal to pursue an Honours BSc. in Environmental Studies. Her thesis focused on rural livelihoods in the Peruvian Amazon. During this time, she also interned at the World Food Programme in Havana, Cuba, an experience that strengthened her interest in sustainable planning for climate resilience and disaster risk management, as well as community-led capacity building and development. This summer, she is working as a research assistant in the UPGo lab and is pivoting her interests to look at housing markets and the impacts of short-term rentals on rural areas across Canada and the United States.
