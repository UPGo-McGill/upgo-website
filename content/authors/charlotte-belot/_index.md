Charlotte is a student in the Master of Urban Planning program at McGill University, and completed a bachelorâ€™s degree in Urban Studies and Architecture at the University of Calgary in 2018. She has experience in urban design and development from a summer internship at the City of Calgary, and has the long-term goal of becoming a professional planner. As an undergraduate, she also worked closely with representatives from the Calgary Chinatown Community Association to develop strategies for community growth and development. Her research interests span both policy and design issues related to the intersection of equity and sustainability in planning, short-term rentals and housing affordability, and community governance. A born-and-raised Calgarian, Charlotte hopes to be an active participant in the urbanism field in Montreal going forward.
