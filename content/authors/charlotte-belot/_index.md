Charlotte is a new graduate of the Master of Urban Planning program at McGill University and is currently seeking opportunities in planning and design. Previously, she completed a bachelorâ€™s degree in Urban Studies and Architecture at the University of Calgary. She is French-English bilingual and skilled in graphic design, GIS analysis, and policy research. As a student, she completed a co-operative education program and worked at multiple levels of government, as well as in big data analysis and housing policy research during her 2019 internship at McGill. She also completed community engagement projects with diverse clients, including the Archdiocese of Montreal and the Calgary Chinatown Community Association, and a year of advanced coursework in architecture. She has developed an intense curiosity for the ways in which narrative is used to frame urban issues, and aims to integrate both creative and investigative elements into her future practice.
