Charlotte is a new urban planner and designer. She graduated from McGill's Master of Urban Planning program in 2020 and previously completed a bachelorâ€™s degree in Urban Studies and Architecture at the University of Calgary. She is French-English bilingual and skilled in graphic design, design visualization, and data-driven site analysis. As a student, Charlotte completed internships at multiple levels of government and with UPGo at McGill. She also has experience engaging diverse communities, including the Archdiocese of Montreal and the Calgary Chinatown Community Association, and is passionate about community planning. Over the course of her education, she developed an intense curiosity for the ways in which narrative is used to frame urban issues, and plans to use her creative and analytical skills to centre equity in her practice. She is currently freelancing as a researcher, translator, graphic designer, and urban design project assistant.
