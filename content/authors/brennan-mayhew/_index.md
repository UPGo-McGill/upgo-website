Brennan Mayhew is a Master’s student at McGill University’s School of Urban Planning. She graduated from Toronto Metropolitan University (formerly Ryerson) with a B.A. in Sociology in 2020. Currently working with David Wachsmuth and UPGo as a graduate research assistant, she is contributing to Canada-wide research for the CMHC, a report on short-term rental regulations. Especially interested in urban design, the right to housing, and the financialization of housing, she continues to pursue these concepts through her academic work and personal projects. While working and completing her Master’s degree, she runs a student magazine, makes art, and volunteers at community kitchens and urban farms in Montreal.
