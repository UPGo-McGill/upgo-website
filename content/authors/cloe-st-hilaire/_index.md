Cloé St-Hilaire is currently a PhD student in Urban Planning at the University of Waterloo. She completed a Master of Urban Planning in 2021 and a Bachelor of Commerce in Sustainability Management and Urban Studies in 2019, both at McGill University. Practical application of her education was gained while working in the social enterprise sector as a food security analyst for a vertical aquaponics start-up. Cloé also worked to promote female entrepreneurship in Senegalese female-led agriculture businesses. Her research interests are at the intersection of housing justice, financialization and the implication of the platform economy in the housing system. She is currently working as a research assistant with the UPGo group, primarily working on the dynamics of the short- and long-term rental markets in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.
