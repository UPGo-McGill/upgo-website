*This is the first part of our series, __COVID-19 and the urban environment__.*

From the first emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic in Wuhan, China to its worldwide spread, the disease has commonly been understood as an urban phenomenon. Urban areas have been hit the hardest, and even those with lesser outbreaks have already seen significant changes to work and social life, and to their urban landscapes and built forms. Over the next several weeks, we will be releasing findings from research we conducted this past summer on COVID and urban life. We aim to provide a broad look at current responses, tactics, and consequences of the pandemic.

**The built environment**

The built environment refers to the totality of human-constructed spaces in which most people live most of their lives, including buildings, transportation systems, and public space (Dietz et al, 2020). The design of the built environment can promote health by advancing active transportation, providing access to clean air and shade, and fostering opportunities for social interaction and cohesion (Oppel, 2020). However, the possibility of the transmission of infectious diseases like COVID-19 via surfaces is a valid concern. While the role of fomites, which refers to both porous and nonporous surfaces or objects (Boone & Gerba, 2007) as transmission vectors is quite clear in some instances, such as not reusing needles or tongue depressors, it is seemingly not as clear when it comes to airborne viruses (Oppel, 2020). Despite some evidence that viruses can be recovered from such surfaces, this does not necessarily mean that surfaces are a significant cause of transmission. While this implies that physical distancing, good ventilation and good hygiene practices may be the centerpiece of preventative measures (Oppel, 2020), the question of surface transmission raises valid questions about the role of dense urban environments in the time of COVID. Over the next few weeks, we will unpack our findings on the impact of COVID-19 on various elements of the built environment, starting with density. 

**A disease of density?**

The outbreak of COVID-19 in major cities across the world is challenging the way people perceive urban growth. “This is not life as usual. There is a density level in NYC that is destructive. It has to stop, and it has to stop now. NYC must develop an immediate plan to reduce density,” tweeted Governor Andrew Cuomo (2020) on March 22 while presiding over one of the deadliest concentrations of the outbreak.

While Cuomo's perspective was common in the early days of the pandemic, even in Spring 2020 there were signs pointing in the other direction. For one, many hyper-dense Asian cities such as Seoul, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Tokyo managed to contain the virus with early detection and strict quarantine enforcement (Patino, 2020).

A later analysis by New York University’s Furman Center (2020) found that, while “COVID-19 is more prevalent in areas where more people reside in crowded units,” the “[o]verall population density is not associated with higher rates of COVID-19 cases.” Even when density is examined in its various aspects — number of inhabitants per area, number of units in a building, and number of residents per unit — the result remains the same: there is no significant correlation between density (or even overcrowding) and higher rates of COVID-19 (Fox, 2020). 

Last but not least, rural America is also experiencing a major spike in infection rates. In the month of April, some rural counties saw an 8-fold increase in COVID-19 infections, a much higher increase than of urban areas (Marema & Murphy, 2020). Michael Hooper (2020), an associate planning professor at Harvard GSD, believes that the panic surrounding density lingers from the fear of “urban penalty,” or the association of dense settlements with increased risk of disease. It seems natural in the North American context, where low-density, suburban models of living have been subsidized both financially and rhetorically for decades, that the discussion of urban penalty currently outpaces that of urban advantage. 

Despite the many advantages to urban living such as lower rates of obesity and lower infrastructural costs, the truth is, cities are meant to bring people together both intellectually and physically, which makes social distancing nearly impossible when a city works well. Furthermore, research shows that “density preferences may be more stable than many of the other perceptions studied so far and, correspondingly, efforts to change densities will likely have to be accompanied by extensive efforts to win over skeptical publics” (Hooper, 2020).
