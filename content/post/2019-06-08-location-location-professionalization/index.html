<p>Along with Robbin Deboosere and Prof. Ahmed El-Geneidy of the Transportation Research at McGill group (TRAM), we’re excited to announce the open access publication of <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21681376.2019.1592699">Location, location, and professionalization: A multilevel hedonic analysis of Airbnb listing prices and revenue</a>. Using hedonic modeling techniques we investigated what factors influence price per night and montlhy revenue of Airbnb listings. We found:</p>
<ul>
<li>Locational factors–above all, transit accessibility to jobs–and neighbourhood variation have a large impact on both price per night and monthly revenue</li>
<li>Professionalization of the short-term rental market is driving more revenue to a narrower segment of hosts</li>
</ul>
<p>Together these findings suggest that Airbnb hosts earn a significant premium by converting long-term housing in transit-accessible residential neighbourhoods. In turn, this incentivizes hosts to replace existing long-term residents with short-term guests, forcing those in search of housing to less accessible neighbourhoods.</p>
<p>Another UPGo paper, <a href="/publication/airbnb-and-the-rent-gap">Airbnb and the rent gap</a>, shows how these incentives are linked to the gentrification of New York City.</p>
