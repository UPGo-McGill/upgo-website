Along with Robbin Deboosere and Prof. Ahmed El-Geneidy of the Transportation Research at McGill group (TRAM), weâ€™re excited to announce the open access publication of [Location, location, and professionalization: A multilevel hedonic analysis of Airbnb listing prices and revenue](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21681376.2019.1592699). Using hedonic modeling techniques we investigated what factors influence price per night and montlhy revenue of Airbnb listings. We found:

- Locational factors--above all, transit accessibility to jobs--and neighbourhood variation have a large impact on both price per night and monthly revenue
- Professionalization of the short-term rental market is driving more revenue to a narrower segment of hosts

Together these findings suggest that Airbnb hosts earn a significant premium by converting long-term housing in transit-accessible residential neighbourhoods. In turn, this incentivizes hosts to replace existing long-term residents with short-term guests, forcing those in search of housing to less accessible neighbourhoods. 

Another UPGo paper, [Airbnb and the rent gap](/publication/airbnb-and-the-rent-gap), shows how these incentives are linked to the gentrification of New York City.
