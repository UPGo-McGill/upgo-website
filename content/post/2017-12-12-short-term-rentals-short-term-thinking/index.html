<p>What is the future of short-term rentals, and what can cities do to benefit from ‘home-sharing’ while avoiding a proliferation of Airbnb hotels? In <a href="https://canadiandimension.com/articles/view/airbnb-short-term-rentals-short-term-thinking">Short-term rentals, short-term thinking</a>, which has just been released in <em><a href="ttps://canadiandimension.com/">Canadian Dimension</a></em>, we summarize the impact of STRs on major Canadian cities, and argue that new STR regulations are necessary and that platforms need to have responsibility for enforcement.</p>
<p>Relying on the same data as our previous report, <a href="http://upgo.lab.mcgill.ca/airbnb">Short-term cities</a>, this article points out the positive influence home-sharing can have on cities, but how far from the case this seems to be in Canada’s three largest cities. Ultimately, STRs in their current form are likely contributing to a substantial loss of housing, the majority of the benefits are being reaped by a small number of hosts, and new regulations are needed.</p>
