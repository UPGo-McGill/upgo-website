abstract: On November 1, 2019, the City of Los Angeles began enforcing STR regulations which had been active but ignored since the summer. The regulations restrict STRs to a host’s principal residence, forbid rentals of rent-stabilized units, and limit listings to 120 nights of reservation per year unless the host receives a special “extended home-sharing option”. This fact sheet summarizes the trajectory of the STR market in Los Angeles before and after the regulations began to be enforced. Our analysis suggests that there has not yet been any substantive enforcement of the new rules with respect to restricting commercial STRs, despite any claims to the contrary.
