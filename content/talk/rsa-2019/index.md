abstract: What do STRs look like from a regional perspective? This presentation provides an initial answer to this question, addressing a "region knowledge gap" in research on short-term rentals. Drawing on spatial and quantative analysis of all STRs in Canada, we identify three key findings. 1) Tourism first- Tourist amenities are the best predictor for STR activity. Other patterns vary across regional contexts, either in terms of direction or strength of effect. 2) Regional differentiation- STRs are more common in low-cost suburbs and high-cost outlying areas. 3) An inverted U- Inner regions appear more closely connected to core cities than suburbs do, but this relationship becomes weaker after 100 km.
