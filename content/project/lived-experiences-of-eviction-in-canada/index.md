The Urban Politics and Governance research group at McGill University is leading a research project for the Canada Mortgage and Housing Company to better understand the lived experiences of eviction in Canada, and help improve tenant protections.

We are currently recruiting participants for interviews across the provinces of British Columbia, New Brunswick and Ontario. We are looking to speak with residents who have a recent (i.e. in the past five years) experience of eviction, but who are now securely housed. In total, we will conduct 90 interviews across the country. Each interview will be approximately one hour long, and participants will be compensated $25 for their time. All interviews will be strictly confidential.

Led by David Wachsmuth, the UPGo team includes PhD students Danielle Kerrigan, Cara Chellew, Matthew Adair, and Cloé St. Hilaire, and Master’s student Brennan Mayhew. Findings from this research will be released in a public report in 2023.
